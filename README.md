# stddevr

This is an R package that contains two functions:

- `standard_deviation`, which returns the standard deviation of values in a numeric vector
- `standard_error`, which returns the standard error of values in a numeric vector

`standard_error` was a contribution made by [mat4nier](https://github.ubc.ca/mat4nier)

## Usage

```
library(stddevr)
standard_deviation(c(1,2,3,4,5))
standard_error(c(1,2,3,4,5))
```
